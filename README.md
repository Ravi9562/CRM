# CRM
This is just for collecting the details from specific mail Id's through Outlook and I have used python for this. In the initial step I just hooked into outlook and then I have put the condition stating that if mail is coming from specific user copy the entire content of the mail body to a file. Later on collect specific details from these mails. I have not used classes and Objects instead I just used the loops and simple coding techniques where a non programmer can understand the code with ease and can modify.
